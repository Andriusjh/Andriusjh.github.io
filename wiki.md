Urban sustainability is a critical strategy in the fight against climate change and its ever-growing negative effects. Chicago’s focus on green spaces and integrated urban design highlights how large metro areas can increase sustainability while improving the quality of life for its residents. By comparison, Seattle’s public transit focus and grassroots environmentalism demonstrate preserving natural beauty while reducing reliance on cars. Despite these efforts, both cities face challenges, such as the displacement of marginalized communities and rising property values, underscoring a need for equitable urban planning.


## Initiatives in Seattle
To better understand urban sustainability within the city of **Seattle** we must take a look back at when it was put into practice in the Emerald City. Studies have explored how Seattle’s urban sustainability initiatives, grassroots activism, and structured planning can become a model for how the public can participate in environmental initiatives. Though the term “urban sustainability” had not officially been coined, practices that would be considered part of this movement were being implemented. During this period, activists worked tirelessly to protect sites like Pike Place Market for social justice and environmental protection reasons. 

Seattle’s urban growth and public transit investments furthered these environmental efforts that began in the 1990s. These practices help to preserve the natural beauty of Seattle and the surrounding area while also reducing the dependency on car transportation for Seattle residents, contributing to Seattle’s sustainability goals. 

## Initiatives in Chicago
Studies have also examined the role of urban sustainability initiatives in one of the biggest metropolitan cities in the United States, **Chicago**, Illinois. We will examine the Chicago Department of Environment’s Adding Green to Urban Design. These initiatives are designed to reduce the greenhouse effect, and urban heat island effect, as well as increase urban green spaces throughout all parts of the city. Specific examples of this include the Green Roof Program and the development of Millenium Park as a green space and outlet for those residents looking to escape the urban aspects of the city. These projects help reach environmental goals while also improving Chicago citizens’ quality of life. 

Differing from Seattle, Chicago’s approach creates a connected network of green spaces throughout the city for its residents. The use of green roofs throughout the city also helps to decrease the effects of urban heat islands and reduces energy consumption. Furthermore, the creation of the Chicago River boardwalk shows the city's constant commitment to expanding green spaces in the city. The boardwalk also provides economic opportunities for the cities through the countless bars and restaurants located on the riverside. These approaches help to magnify the city's urban resilience and its efforts toward promoting urban sustainability. 

## Challenges
Studies in Seattle have also shown that in many cases, these efforts come with tradeoffs disproportionately faced by marginalized communities. These sustainability efforts often lead to higher property values and a displacement of marginalized communities, specifically among people of color. Comparing Portland and Seattle shows how urban planning must consider equitable goals while also focusing on the environment. This focus on lessening urban sprawl can have unintended consequences like displacement and rising property values, which disproportionately disadvantage people of color and their communities. Urban sustainability requires a **balance** between social equity considerations, as well as grassroots activism and policy innovation. 

Chicago has had negative effects caused by their promotion of these initiatives. A key part of the process in Chicago is that a wide range of individuals including business leaders, community members, and lawmakers are all a part of the city development strategy. Though not perfect, this allows the strategy to be more equitable for all residents living within the Chicago city limits. Urban sustainability efforts are also connected to issues related to social equity. These efforts can displace low-income communities due to the high costs related to creating a sustainable city. Like the city of Seattle, this shows a central challenge in creating a more sustainable urban environment while being conscientious of the social consequences related to these efforts.
